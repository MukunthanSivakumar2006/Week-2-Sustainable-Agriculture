# ðŸŒ¿ Week 2 â€“ Improvisations in AI-Powered Smart Crop Recommendation System

## ðŸ”§ Improvements Made

1. **Feature Scaling**

   * Applied StandardScaler to normalize soil and environmental feature values.
   * Helped improve model stability and accuracy.

2. **Train-Test Split**

   * Divided dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
   * Ensured unbiased model evaluation.

3. **Multiple Algorithms Tested**

   * Implemented and compared Decision Tree, Random Forest, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
   * Identified **Random Forest** as the best-performing algorithm.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

   * Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
   * Improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * Measured Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
   * Added confusion matrices and performance comparison charts.

6. **Visualization**

   * Created bar charts to compare accuracy of different models.
   * Plotted confusion matrices for better understanding of predictions.
