#  Week 2-Sustainable-Agriculture

## 🌱 AI-Powered Smart Crop Recommendation System

## 📌 Objective

* Build baseline ML models for crop recommendation.
* Train and test multiple algorithms to identify the most accurate model.
* Improve results through preprocessing, scaling, and tuning.

---

## 🛠️ Work Done

* Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (handled missing values, normalized features).
* Implemented ML models:

  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Naïve Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Logistic Regression
* Compared performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
* Applied **feature scaling** to improve performance.
* Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.
* Visualized results using plots and confusion matrices.

## 📂 Deliverables

* **Notebooks**:

  * `EDA.ipynb` – Exploratory Data Analysis
  * `Model_Building.ipynb` – Training multiple ML models
  * `Evaluation.ipynb` – Performance comparison

* **Scripts (src/)**:

  * `preprocess.py` – Data cleaning & scaling
  * `train.py` – Model training
  * `evaluate.py` – Metrics calculation

* **Results**:

  * Accuracy reports for all models
  * Confusion matrices
  * Accuracy comparison chart

* **Documentation**:

  * `improvisations.md` – Summary of improvements done in Week 2
  * `requirements.txt` – Dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

---

## 📈 Key Results

* Best performing model: **Random Forest** (after tuning)
* Achieved accuracy: **XX%** (replace with your actual result)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Week 3 Preview)

* Build Flask web app for deployment.
* Integrate trained model into an interactive UI.
* Test system with different input values.

Do you also want me to prepare the **`improvisations.md` file content** so you can just copy-paste that too?
